title: 5 ways to build a cryptocurrency portfolio
---

If you're thinking of investing in cryptocurrencies, you have probably come to the same conclusion that the Crypto Monkey has, that the industry has potential to grow. If you're thinking of building a portfolio, chances are, like the Crypto Monkey, you are probably not sure which coin or coins are going to come out on top.

Here are five different strategies you could follow to choose your portfolio. 

## 5. Read the charts

Just as in traditional financial markets you will see a lot of 'technical analysis' of different cryptocurrency charts. Fibonacci levels, Elliot waves, Stochastics, the list goes on. If you want to learn this stuff you wil find no end of 'analysts' willing to teach you their techniques - for a small fee! 

Chart-reading is nothing new. Astrologers have been reading charts for thousands of years, trying to predict the future from events that happened in the past. Sometimes they get it right, mostly not. The Crypto Monkey doesn't believe in all that stuff.

## 4. Fundamental analysis

Traditional financial markets also support another group of analysts, those who eschew the charts and focus on the 'fundamentals' of assets. The cryptocurrency world is no different. If you are tech-savvy, you could probably get a good idea of how technologically sound a cryptocurrency is in a couple of hours, if you're business-savvy you could analyse the business strategy in a couple more. The only problem is, there are well over a thousand cryptocurrency projects in the world right now. The Crypto Monkey doesn't have time for all that.

## 3. Follow a guru

How about following a guru? There are plenty of soothsayers in the market. The choice is endless, technical analysts, fundamenal analysts, astrologers, crystal ball gazers, take your pick!

## 2. The blind monkey

The legendary blind monkey, (in whose honour this blog was named) has frequently outperformed other analysts in traditional financial markets by choosing investments at random. You could follow that strategy and probably do better that the other three methods.

## 1. Invest in an index

It was [recently reported](https://www.ccn.com/former-paypal-executives-have-invested-millions-in-cryptocurrency-index-fund/) that some former Paypal executives have invested $4M in the 'Bitwise Hold 10' crytocurrency index fund. Now there's an idea! Investing in an index has always been a good way for part-timers to manage their traditional investments, why not cryptos?

The Crypto Monkey was ready to break open the piggy bank and deposit his savings alongside those $4M! There's just one snag, to invest in that Bitwise fund you need to be a 'US Accredited Investor' which in layman's terms means you need a disposable net worth of $1M and a minimum investment of $25,000. 

Mmmm, the Crypto Monkey doesn't have that much in the jar, but hey, surely he could just buy the same coins in the same proportion as the fund does! Well there's really nothing stopping him, or you, except that it involves a little bit of work. You need to find an exchange that sells all the coins you need, figure out how many of each coin to buy and place the orders. Not too bad, but to keep your funds in balance you'll need to re-balance your portfolio each month. A lot less work than analysing the fundamentals of a thousand odd coins but still not a trivial task.

Well, don't despair. We've put together an easy to use system to help the Crypto Monkey calculate the trades he needs to make and you can also make use of the system right here. Just choose the exchange you want to invest in, how much you have to invest, the number of different coins you want to hold in your 'index' and the system will tell you which trades you need to make! Best of all, it's completely free!

Please try it out, we'd love to hear what you think.
